I forget to bring my money to the school....
And my mom was pretty angry.

Go to the zoo with my parents. I saw a lot of animals.
Lion, sheep, dog, rabbit, polar bear, camel, elephant, wolf, elk, giraffe, and of course the horses.

AES introduction
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is formal
encryption method adopted by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology of the US Government, and
is accepted worldwide. This paper introduces AES and
key management, and discusses some important topics
related to a good data security strategy.

In 1997 the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), a branch of the US government,
started a process to identify a replacement for the Data
Encryption Standard (DES). It was generally recognized
that DES was not secure because of advances in
computer processing power. The goal of NIST was to
define a replacement for DES that could be used for
non-military information security applications by US
government agencies. Of course, it was recognized that
commercial and other non-government users would
benefit from the work of NIST and that the work would
be generally adopted as a commercial standard.
The NIST invited cryptography and data security
specialists from around the world to participate in the
discussion and selection process. Five encryption
algorithms were adopted for study. Through a process
of consensus the encryption algorithm proposed by
the Belgium cryptographers Joan Daeman and Vincent
Rijmen was selected. Prior to selection Daeman and
Rijmen used the name Rijndael (derived from their
names) for the algorithm. After adoption the encryption
algorithm was given the name Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) which is in common use today.
In 2000 the NIST formally adopted the AES encryption
algorithm and published it as a federal standard under
the designation FIPS-197. The full FIPS-197 standard
is available on the NIST web site (see the Resources
section below). As expected, many providers of
encryption software and hardware have incorporated
AES encryption into their products.

The AES encryption algorithm is a block cipher that uses
an encryption key and several rounds of encryption. A
block cipher is an encryption algorithm that works on a
single block of data at a time. In the case of standard AES
encryption the block is 128 bits, or 16 bytes, in length. The
term “rounds” refers to the way in which the encryption
algorithm mixes the data re-encrypting it ten to fourteen
times depending on the length of the key.
The AES algorithm itself is not a computer program or
computer source code. It is a mathematical description
of a process of obscuring data. A number of people have
created source code implementations of AES encryption,
including the original authors.

AES encryption uses a single key as a part of the
encryption process. The key can be 128 bits (16 bytes),
192 bits (24 bytes), or 256 bits (32 bytes) in length. The
term 128-bit encryption refers to the use of a 128-bit
encryption key. With AES both the encryption and the
decryption are performed using the same key. This is
called a symmetric encryption algorithm. Encryption
algorithms that use two different keys, a public and a
private key, are called asymmetric encryption algorithms.
An encryption key is simply a binary string of data used
in the encryption process. Because the same encryption
key is used to encrypt and decrypt data, it is important
to keep the encryption key a secret and to use keys that
are hard to guess. Some keys are generated by software
used for this specific task. Another method is to derive a
key from a pass phrase. Good encryption systems never
use a pass phrase alone as an encryption key.

Introduction of RSA
Ever since people began to write down events in their lives, there has been a need for cryptography.
Cryptography is the encryption of text in such a manner that outsiders to the code cannot
understand the code, but the desired reader is able to decrypt the encryption so as to understand
the message. For early man, just as for modern man, there has always been a need for secrecy,
because it is usually in the interest of both the decoders and encoders that the information not
be known to the general public. In times of war, it is essential that the enemy not know what
you and your allies are plotting, because winning or losing a war can hinge on the secrecy of the
operations so as to surprise the enemy. However, there was one caveat to all the cryptosystems
before RSA: they were all based on the fact that both the decoding and encoding parties had to
know the method of encryption and the key to decrypting the cipher. In truth, this problem of key
distribution is the same problem people were trying to solve when they invented cryptography:
the keys and the method of decryption need to be relayed to all the desired readers of the message,
but how does one relay the key securely? Why, with encryption, of course. But, then how to you
send the key to the encryption of the key to the encryption of the message? As you can see, this
caveat of cryptography is an infinite loop between encryption and key distribution that cannot be
solved with security ensured for all the desired readers. Indeed, the Germans might have won the
war had it not been for the fact that they had to print out their daily settings for the Enigma
machine and hand them out to all the Nazi leaders. One of the key-books was intercepted by
the English and this led to a crucial defeat for the Germans that crippled their submarine fleet.
Anyways, the problem of key distribution remained a problem until the 20th century.

The problem was solved by Whitfield Diffie, working in collaboration with Martin Hellman. The
idea came to him in a revelation: “I walked downstairs to get a Coke, and almost forgot about the
idea. I remembered that I’d been thinking about something interesting, but couldn’t quite recall
what it was. Then it came back in a real adrenaline rush of excitement. I was actually aware
for the first time in my work on cryptography of having discovered something really valuable.”
(The source for this quote, and all the other historical material in this section, is [3].) Diffie had
discovered a revolutionary type of cipher: his cipher incorporated an asymmetric key. In all the
other cryptosystems, decryption is simply the opposite of encryption; these systems employ a
symmetric key, because decryption and encryption are symmetrical. In an asymmetrical cipher,
there are two distinct keys: the public and private keys. The private key is the decryption key and
the public key is the encryption key. If a person, Bob, wants to send a message to another person,
Alice, all he has to do is use Alice’s public key to encrypt the message. Now the only person
in the universe that can decrypt that message is Alice, because she has the private decryption
key; Bob encrypts the message using the public key, but he cannot decrypt it: the encryption
technique is a one-way function, which is irreversible unless the decoder has a special piece of
knowledge unknown to the rest of the world (the private key). Although Diffie conceived of a
general concept of an asymmetric cipher, he did not actually have a specific one way function that
met his requirements. However, his paper (published in 1975) showed that there was indeed a
solution to key distribution and he sparked interest among other mathematicians and scientists.
Try as he might, Diffie and his partners Hellman and Merkle could not discover such a cipher.
That discovery was made by another trio of researchers: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.
Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman were a perfect team. Rivest is a computer scientist with an exemplary
ability to apply new ideas in new places. He also kept up with the latest scientific papers, so
he always had these zany new ideas for the one way function. Shamir, also a computer scientist,
has a lightning intellect, and an ability to cast aside the technicalities and focus on the core of a
problem. He as well as Rivest generated ideas for the one-way function. Adleman is a mathematician
with extraordinary stamina, rigor and patience. He was largely responsible for spotting the
flaws within the ideas of Rivest and Shamir, and he ensured that they did not follow false leads.
Rivest and Shamir spent a year coming up with ideas, and Adleman spent a year shooting them
down. It was very discouraging, but they knew that each failure steered them away from sterile
math into more fertile mathematical ground. In April 1977, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman spent
Passover at the house of a student and consumed liberal quantities of Manischewitz wine before
returning to their respective homes sometime around midnight. Rivest was unable to sleep, so he
lay on his couch with a math textbook. He began to mull over the question that had been nagging
him all year: Is it possible to find a one-way function that can be reversed only if the receiver has
some special information? Suddenly, the mists began to clear and he had a revelation. He spent
the rest of the night formalizing his idea, and by daybreak he had effectively written a complete
mathematical paper. Rivest had a breakthrough, but it could not have come without the help of
Shamir and Adleman. The system was later dubbed RSA, for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.

MD5 introduction from wiki
The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.

Like most hash functions, MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding. It can be reversed by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.

MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4.[3] The source code in RFC 1321 contains a "by attribution" RSA license. The MD5 hash function receives its acronym MD from its structure using Merkle–Damgård construction.[citation needed]

The security of the MD5 has been severely compromised, with its weaknesses having been exploited in the field, most infamously by the Flame malware in 2012. The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5 essentially "cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use".
